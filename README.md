just another repository

Hi Everyone,
I am Diana.  I am a GIS Geek that wants to learn how to create fabulous web maps for Business Intelligence, or just for fun things like travel.  I have watched a few videos on HTML, JavaScript and CSS, but not really sure how all of the moving parts need to be laid out to get the desired results.

I never had a taco on the moon, but might one day, although I don't really like tacos, so maybe some lentil pasta.
